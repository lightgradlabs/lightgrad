# lightgrad
CUDA-free lightweight AI framework for real open development.
**Why LightGrad?**  
NVIDIA's CUDA ecosystem locks out millions of devs without access to expensive GPUs.  
LightGrad aims to build a new path — a framework that works on CPU, WebGPU, and open infra from day one.

🧠 Inspired by: TinyGrad, Triton, HuggingFace  
💻 Built with: Python, WebGPU, OpenAI tools  
🌎 Goal: Democratize model training and inference for the 99%

## 🎯 Project Goals

- [x] Launch initial repo (this!)
- [ ] Add CPU-based matmul engine
- [ ] Add basic graph executor
- [ ] Support WebGPU for browser compute
- [ ] TinyLLM inference demo

## 🤝 Join the Mission

This is a public movement to open up AI for all.  
Star this repo. Fork it. Watch it grow.
